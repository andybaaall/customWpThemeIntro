### Installation
To install this project you'll need to run the following terminal commands (and make sure you're running a stable version of NPM):

```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/andybaaall/customWpThemeIntro
    $ cd customWpThemeIntro
    $ npm install
```

Once you've done that, you'll need to install Wordpress. If you don't know how to do that, there's some fantastic documentation on [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/)!

As soon as you've got Wordpress set up, you can copy this project into your Wordpress themes folder and check it out. :)
